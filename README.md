# Product Management
Product management is an organisation function that manages all the various stages of the product lifecycle. They do not project manageme, develop nor market the product but have key inputs across various deparments in developing a solution. 

# Product Lifecycle 
The product lifcycle chronicls the various stages of a product from ideation and inception, engineering design, manufacture, ongoing servicing and disposal. Even though a product may reach the end of its lifespan it does not mean that it cannot be continued through other ways such as rebranding or introducing a new version of the same device.
